Object Oriented Programming:
"An organized method of writing codes."
It involves:
1. Classes                             |   2. Objects                                   |   3. Methods
Class is like a blueprint for the      |   Objects are the entities in the world.       |   These are the functions
entities.                              |                                                |   written in the classes
                                       |                                                |   for the properties.
For example:
Toyota Car company have created a blueprint for the other cars building to follow that particular blueprint.
So, the blueprint is the class and the other cars which have to follow that blueprint are called the objects.
